todo:

reorganize all custommobs to use new attacks thing and whatever (including blaze).
comment syntax update
line lengths
space after cast
TODO plural reference to mob changes
TODO periods in all /**/ comments (same as javadoc)
big comment separator for inner classes
move instance variables to appropriate interface sections
private instead of protected where possible
overriden functions like checkdespawn try to use descriptive variable names
dont target villagers
standardize customentity.this vs this.customentity in inner goal classes: always this. with statuc class? (if possible)
all classes have blank line following declaration
custom inner goals extending melee/ranged attack/targeting etc. dont need field for parent; just inherit this.goalowner
stopped after: ghast


revise multiline comments in initpathfinder()s

followrange should be an instance variable instead of set through the getfollowrange function? be mindful of changing it during attacks?
    otherwise ignoresy and los shouldnt be static vars either? check if good practice

increment attacks in attack method/goal instead of listener

entity_ to just _

convert classes with a lot of different constructors (e.g. spawnentity, target goals, entityfilter?) to builder pattern for anything beyond the basic, common constructor params? e.g. target condition for target goals?
    use build instead of set for method name?

make buffmobs goal and possibly getbuffs less janky? such as not requiring manual e() activation and replacing of goal. and also buildbuffshashmap is awkward with having to manually reinput attack thresholds

things in terms of getattackthresholds instead of hardcoded

stadnardize comment location outside/inside method

remove checkdespawn for mobs with follow distance <= 32




registerGenericAttribute() into util with static? pass in this. pulling attributemap in initattribute too

should reflection fields be static? in line with this: reflection util to hide try catch and stuff?

hoglins either have insane reach. also golems too? OR for golem: copy in enderman block steal goal, except steal blocks around player and place underneath self. test if it can hit while suffocated

mobs when hit by a player further than detection range/cant see: they teleport to player. teleport util?

when addign random + constant always have constant first?

is teleportneartarget really needed? just have y level teleport always? and make y level teleport to nearest player horizontally, not attack target

hurtbytarget rename to hurtbyplayer? otherwise target class must be passed in

piglin frenzy when you open chest; make frenzy have explosive effects and set attack target if possible

make sure vec3d is mot_/direction_ and not vec+ or whatever; and make sure x/y/z are accessed via getters

does server kill projectiles on player join? that's mad exploitable. rather do it on world load or something?. still exploitable though...check if possible on plugin load?

check relog punish

endermites and silverfish should die after a random long time

skeletons less arrows

either make sure drowned tridents are hitscan or make pufferfish teleport and ignore y

runnables like spawn entity and fireball ring DO NOT have to be runnables?; check performance and also check what runnables actually do (if theyre not async, theyre useless?)

wrap spawnentity in util function that creates runnable instance so we dont need awkward new every time?
    does spawnentity even need to be a runnable?
    wrap all runnables in util function that simply calls run/runtasktimer appropriately without ugly `new` starting the line?

all utils should be static

static methods referenced within same class: make sure class name reference!






better documentation for removing y-level/los requirements for finding targets

change this.entity in goals to this.goalowner?

personalize all doc comments with mob name?

standardize function etc multiline formatting:
func(
    params
)

`` all code in comments

pink sheep and stuff dont do the fling into the air to avoid knockback thing?

aggressive villagers sweat or have custom texture or something (register custom entity?)

no blank lines after class declaration and before instance variable decalarations?

all -- and ++ to after if possible

be funny and make thorns spawn cacti? make sure cacti do a lot of damage. but also prevent abuse?

all static initializer blocks before constructors?

listeners group by event?

charged creeper power nerf?

check high chance for stone etc block to have silverfish

util function/wrapper for find entity with default predicate (nmsworld.a(), and getentities() too? difference?)
    also find entity with predicate? to give meaning to the obfuscated function names

make all variables/parameters starting with entity not start with entity

overridden functions and stuff organize alphabetiocal?

nms, bukkit etc labels use underscore?

is iattacklevelingmob == icustomhostile?

add polar bear?

better nametag names? like wtf is "insert name here"

standarize where to use final

standaridze static final (constant) capitalization
    external constant variable references use class name dot, but not internal? all caps to differentiate from local variable?
    but nested classes always use dot?

multi0pole ternary operators: align vertically

standardize randoms (global one? goals use entity's one?). seems like vanilla goals use entity's one

make sure all hurtbytarget goals have priorirty 0

line breaking complicated stuff with master level and and nested ors etc: indent accordingly like in custompathfindergoalhurtbytarget's callforhelp()

try to line break on equals

dying after certain number of ticks make a goal?

line breaks parameters (only function delcarations): break on new item, indent up to start of first parameter (re: custompathfindergoalnearestattackabetarget). same with arithmetic, nested functions in params etc.
    remove blank line after?
rhs side of euqals red customentitycreeper explode()

investigate why we need to remove goals, particularly nearestattackabletarget. e.g. zombie remoive vanilla villager aggro?

all function comments + @override: comments on top

check what happens when you dont allow friendly fire in custompathfindertargetcondition for bat and evoker

catalog and test super zombie health nerf + xp health gain

custom class for large fireball summon lightning and separate newpathfindergoalshootlargefireballs too; also test todo in lightning storm runnable

uncomment things in custompathfindergoalrangedattack after that

bL() doesnt seem to work sometimes? check again

does bL() need to be in icustomhostile? is it possible to globalize it like g() and d()?

investigate why some mobs dont need bl() (maxfallheight) or checkdespawn()

some mob gains levitation when youre on higher y level? which would be the funniest mob that doesnt already have a y-level mitigatino feature. also make mob break blocks around it as it ascends

all util classes not abstract, but include private constryuctor

optimize predicates (not bedrock into base? etc)

optimize fall damage algo further? check what happens in cobweb, sweet bush, scaffold

make thor lightning storm less constant and anIgnoreYing

thor general refactoring (sketchy ListenerLightningStrike.storm?)

taming a cat or ocelot sumkins creepers nearby?

try to move from listener to mobs if not too hard
    but if no method on mob spawn in nms: all tickslived == 5 to spawn listener?
    if no method on mob death (before death anim finishes): move all gethealth < 0.0 in tick() to death listener?
    but also try to move stuff from listeners like listenermobdeath to the mobs themselves? note that die() might wait until death anim is over
    or mob spawn to tickslived==1 if it fires on rejoining world/restarting server

allow only one lightning effect storm and one tornado at a time with static variables or something

convert num* to *count
    convert max* to *countmax?

merge lightningeffectstorm and lightningstorm runnable with config for percentage actual lightning

try to copy spider code for moving fast in cobwebs?

husk instead of using anvil storms and sand storms create actual sandstorm runnable similar to tornado but without suction?  so just a lot of sand everywhere

zombie harming aec on death repurpose for death of witch?

bug: thor lightning persists on death

trident should not break blocks if thrown by player

channeling trident not working

where do player projectiles fall faster? seems to be impacting drowned tridents?

change TagsBlock.ENDERMAN_HOLDABLE blocks??? like end stone for example

comment/javadoc custom goals functions, including inner classes. see customentityblaze inner class for example

comment and javadoc order: which one first? see blockoverride

attacks comments/docs all into initattack method instead of increase attacks?

remove unnecessary casts???

util function for Bukkit.getServer().getOnlinePlayers().size()?

isntead of teleporting near y, creepers teleport onto player if cant see after a while, like enderman? make this a goal with customizable chances? (cant see, diff y level)

make sure soul speed boots dont drop.

breakblocksaround goals make sure never remove blocks underneath unless intentional?

pay with targetchance in nearestattackabletarget; seems to try and stagger execution of goals?

iron golem bug s till tries to attack other entities after plaayer goes into creative (and also calls statmultiply from listener?)

fix iron golem spawning with iron blocks not removing iron blocks

villagerdamage and death listeners from raidandvillager to just mob damage? and rename raidandvillager to just raid

less hacky way for bukkitplayer set velocity runnable in playerdamagelistener? setDeltaMovement() from forge; check spigot equiv (for lauunching player)

trader llama extra scary?

iron golem sethelath in increashealthadd change to heal? and make sure works

balancing and small nerfs like ghast or something, more consistent but less endermites on enderman death etc, no magma cube spawns from blaze

make lava spread fast in overworld if possible?

remove blank line before cobnstrcutors/fields

why are we adding customhurtbytarget in vanillapthfindergoalsaccess? should we do it individually?

hoglin fire trails to custom goal?

phantom more linear size increases?

phantom check that die() override delay doesn't matter

have a mob that increases CustomPathfinderGoalMovement move speed???

lower magma cube spawn replacement chance? unless no spawn from blaze is enough of a nerf

check all the goals comments esp ranged to add clarification to y-level (all from the entities' overridden .g() or whatever), and make sure also specified regardless of LOS

make dragon fight logic cleaner, as well as ending messages? find exploits
    check out enderdragonbattle.class (in mcp: world/end/dragonfightmanager)

move some broadcast messages like the end of the dragon fight to disaply full screen? search google for how

piglin frenzy etc use proper getters and setters

piglin still attacks in creative (isinvulnerable check somewhere?)

bug: piglins seem to still drop item theyre holding; check other mobs too

fake illusioner little damage but big tankiness

creeper, phantom etc try having custom init for initFuse() or whatever instead of constructor and doing hacky reflection stuff in spawnentity. and pass entity instance to spawnentity instead of all this forced compatability with constructors? also dragon uuid? also fake illuisioner parent? or have like a second constrcutor without out the extra init calling this() with a default value for spawnentity or something

see if possible to create utils for shooting large and small fireballs etc?

getbuffedbymobs goal: increase attacks by a percentage

those thbat do something upon death, like ghasts abnd evokers that do it in tick(), check if there is a function that is called before death so don't have to do it in tick()

check weather changes works

try to debofuscate goals using idtech thing, experiment with changing seetime requirement etc

util functions to set (decrease or increase) max health and health?

more creative effects for mooshroom milking (maybe random sus stew with most chance for bad effects instead)

reduce magma cube jump distance so they dont overshoot following range

break blocks ruunnable instead of booleans to remove dluuids etc just pass in a static predicate to the constrcutor

bug: slimes and magma blocks just run away, their targeting is mega f*cked
    make sure to test new melee attack goal thoguh

check balancing for slime/magma cube damage and melee attack radius

bug?: players still lose bubbles slower when fully submerged than when feet submerged

all mob expliosions and stuff make sure mobgriefing gamerule is respected. make util function for this?

players dont lose bubbles when feet submerged and not moving due to playermovelistener being used

mobs still taking magma block damage?

test teleportnear player goals like creeper, refine if needed

somehow nerf endermen drops. for example, drop ender shards (custom item?) which is crafted in 4 to make ender pearl. or just nerf the drop rates lol

early return guards for isclientside and stuff

would be funny to have some good mob have avoidentity goal like villager avoiding player or something

slimes and mamga cubes still get trapped in cobwebs; just break them?

guardians arent attacking out of water

tridents break block instead of explode

dragon does more when all crystals down? random spam blaze + exploding + aec harming + aec poison fireballs or more interesting? set phase charge player more?

mobs dont get affected by soul sand or magma blocks in water

make sure spawner mobs all have nametags (end etc.)

slightly less inaccuracy for player arrows, and add inaccuracy for player tridents/snowballs/eggs/all projectiles honestly including pearls?

surely crystal destruction is mini wither

speed up dragon fireball projectile speeds

add turtle?

standarize line break to give first line as much as posisble?

bug: exiting rejoining causes withers to still aggro other mobs

standardize super in functions start/end

zoglin something more for 25 attacks now that throw players around is not a thing

pufferfish on feet in water only in survival

change eggs lottery to json or something/loot table

should util classes be abstract? or unnecessary

spawn entity nametag option. make sure mobs spawning other mobs should have nametag

find better solution for bed destruction on respawn? see if possible to find bed respawned from, or maybe just set all bed blocks around spawn to air

remove all abilities to attack regardless of y level and just have more ways to bring player down/reach player?

create full documentation of changes from all /* comments and that google doc?

optimize imports; ordering too?




balance changes catalog:
mobs teleport to the player that hurt them if they are outside range/do not have line of sight
Mobs not ignoring line of sight will no longer stop targeting if they lose line of sight
